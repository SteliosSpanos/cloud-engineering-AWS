# Cloud Security with AWS IAM

## Overview

In this project we'll be using the AWS **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** service to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) in our AWS account.

We'll also launch two **EC2** instances and control who has access to them by creating some **IAM policies** and **user groups**.  

**Amazon EC2** is a service that lets you rent and use virtual computers in the cloud. You can create, customize and use these computers for all different reasons, from running applications to hosting websites.
