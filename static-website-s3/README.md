# Static Website Hosting on AWS S3

## Overview

**Cloud computing** moves the computing power from the physical devices we own to services we can access over the internet, anytime and anywhere. It moves all that work to massive data centers run by companies like Amazon. These data centers have enormous amounts of storage and processing power that your computer can use over the internet.

In this project we'll see how we can host a static website on AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud.

The service we are going to use is called **S3 Storage**:
- It stores and receives any amount of data at anytime from anywhere on the web.
- It's one of the most important and fundamental services to start with.
